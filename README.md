ML: Titanic Data set (Kaggle) Decision Trees and Random Forrest, Naive Bayes with SKlearn
This file shows how I used the Python library SKlearn to solve the famous Titanic Survivor prediciton problem. I used matplotlib to clean and analyse the data. I trained  Decision trees, Random Forrest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB) to predict which passengers would survive their trip on the titanic. The best result was achived with a decision tree which correctly predicted who would survive 82% of the time.
